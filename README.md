# Virtual-Tennis
A tennis ball like game developed in C++ environment
 
This game was developed by me few years ago while I was a beginner at coding. No gaming engine or API is used, just basic stuff. So, appologies for not properly organizing code.

HOW TO COMPILE/ RUN:
Simply paste the code in a C++ editor. 
Enjoy !!

CONTRIBUTIONS ARE INVITED  :)
